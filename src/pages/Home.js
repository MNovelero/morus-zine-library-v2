            The Museum of Reclaimed Urban Space Zine Library was created to support the museumâ€™s mission of preserving and
             promoting the history of grassroots activism in the Lower East Side of Manhattan. This library elevates and 
             makes accessible the oftentimes disenfranchised and marginalized voices represented through these typically 
             free publications. First organized in 2021 by the Archive Committee at MoRUS, the MoRUS Zine Library was made 
             up of donations from visitors and former museum volunteers. Moving forward the scope of our zine collection 
             policy will be focused on subjects and genres ranging from DIY, history, and art that deal with topics like 
             housing, environmentalism, and activism, especially those emanating from New York City. Despite these 
             collection restrictions, the library will continue to reflect the diverse communities of stakeholders concerned
             with each of these topics.
